### Performance

- Handles 1000+ processes smoothly
- CPU usage: 2-5% typical
- Memory usage: 80-150 MB
- Refresh rate: 2 seconds (configurable)

### Known Limitations

- Requires psutil for full functionality

- Some process details may be hidden without elevated privileges
- Process Tree, Network, and Search History tabs still placeholder

## Version 1.0.1 (2025-10-08) - Bug Fix Release

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed `AttributeError: 'ProcessesView' object has no attribute 'process_table'`
  - Moved `populate_table()` call to after `self.process_table` assignment
  - Removed premature `populate_table()` call from `create_process_table()` method
  - This was causing the application to crash on startup

### Added
- **Launcher Scripts**: 
  - `run_elpm.sh` for Linux/macOS with automatic PyQt6 installation
  - `run_elpm.bat` for Windows with automatic PyQt6 installation
- **Documentation**:
  - `INSTALL.md` - Comprehensive installation guide with troubleshooting
  - `QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference for getting started
  - `test_imports.py` - Import verification script
- **README Updates**:
  - Added troubleshooting section to `README_PYQT.md`
  - Added environment setup instructions
  - Added DPI scaling solutions

## How to Report Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues:

1. Check `INSTALL.md` and `README_PYQT.md` for known solutions
2. Verify you're using Python 3.8+ and PyQt6 is installed
3. Run `test_imports.py` to verify setup
4. Check that you're in the correct directory (`src/`)
5. Look for similar issues in this changelog

## Migration from React Version

This PyQt6 version maintains visual parity with the React version while adapting to desktop application patterns:

- Tabs instead of React routing
- Native Qt widgets instead of web components
- QPainter for custom graphics instead of Recharts
- Qt stylesheets instead of Tailwind CSS
- Python dataclasses instead of TypeScript interfaces
